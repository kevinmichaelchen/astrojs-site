        I was inspired to use <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank"
          >AstroJS</a
        > since this site will be static, with the rare exception, such as the navbar.
        Astro lets you use any UI framework (e.g., React, Preact, etc) and checks
        a lot of SEO boxes (image optimization, RSS, sitemaps, etc). It's also built
        with the
        <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/" target="_blank"
          >Islands Architecture</a
        > in mind so that the client receives as little JS as necessary.
