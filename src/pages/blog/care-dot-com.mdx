In my next role post-IrisVR, I was looking for similar tech-stack environment: Golang, AWS, Kafka, gRPC, protobufs, microservices, event-driven, etc.

Care.com had that technology, but it also had more process, more infrastructure, more documentation, more everything â€” due to its 200+ engineers.

I learned a lot from more senior engineers. Little things, like how to write table-driven unit tests using nothing but the standard library, <Link href="https://gist.github.com/kevinmichaelchen/6afae8ecf0bfb28248877c39abaf0ced" external>when/where to declare an interface</Link>, etc.
But also more important things: habits like _"stop starting, start stopping"_, agreeing on a good _definition of done_, awareness about over-engineering (KISS), etc.

Here are some of my highlights there:

## Win 1: Code Quality and Docs

A lot of this is kind of grunt work. You definitely won't get promoted for it, but the little things lead to better experiences down the road.

It's unclear what kind of impact improving the readability of a function, or boosting unit test coverage, has. But it can't hurt.

Code quality was something I was thinking about a lot.

At a larger org, there will be many teams. People will be hop in your team's Slack channel and ask technical or domain questions.
I always tried to be as responsive and helpful as possible. Responding to Slack inquiries are a kind of documentation in their own right.
When people have a question, chances are someone else has asked it in Slack before. I would often create some quick diagrams in Draw.io and attach them to Slack messages,
to visually explain parts of our stack. Maybe this would cause Slack to inadvertently compete with Confluence as a source of truth
for documentation, but I didn't think that was necessarily a bad thing.
