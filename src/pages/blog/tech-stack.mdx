What tech stack interests me as of September 2022?

## Terminals

Good ol' Mac Terminal has been pretty good to me.
I tried [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) but it didn't click.
I get a lot of mileage from
[oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/),
[Z](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/z),
and ZSH [auto-suggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions).

## Desktop

[Tauri](https://tauri.app/) improves on Electron; it's faster and consumes fewer resources.

## UI Development

### Frameworks

Theo gives a [good discussion](https://youtu.be/v5WDJ6U_TmQ?t=497) on
which front-end framework to pick.

Use [AstroJS](https://astro.build/) for static sites (e.g., marketing sites).

Use [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for interactive webapps.

### UI Libraries

[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) seems to improve on a lot of the mistakes and
tech debt React is built on.
[Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw3Bx5vxKl0) and
[Jack Herrington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqcHoLWyyIw)
give a pretty good overview.
You can use JSX so you'll feel at home if you've used React before,
but offers improvements in terms of performance, reactivity, state management, and more.

### Dependencies

For dependencies, I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-vs-npm) to save on
space and have a cleaner node_modules.

### Runtimes

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) can lead to faster server-side-rendered (SSR) React.
From this Semaphore [blog post](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/javascript-bun):
"Bun is intended to be a drop-in replacement for Node, Webpack, Babel, Yarn, and PostCSS â€” all in one neat package."

Then there's [Deno](https://deno.land/),
which has no build step and
deploys sites [blazingly fast](https://youtu.be/Q4dos7-gX68?t=1510).

## Styling

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is what I'd use for styling.
It [differs from UI kits](https://blog.logrocket.com/tailwind-css-vs-bootstrap-ui-kits/) of
yesteryear (e.g., Bootstrap) in that you get more flexibility and customizability.
With Tailwind, you might not need a component library like [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/);
instead you could just create your own component library.

For consistency between React and React Native (mobile),
[Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/) looks appealing.

## Databases

For document DBs, you can check out [Fauna](https://fauna.com/),
[DynamoDB](https://fauna.com/blog/compare-fauna-vs-dynamodb), or
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

With SQL, popular choices are MySQL and Postgres.
For scale, I might look at [Vitess](https://vitess.io/)/[Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) for MySQL,
or [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/), [Yugabyte](https://www.yugabyte.com/), or [Neon](https://neon.tech/) ("serverless") for Postgres.

For small projects, [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) looks like a convenient open-source NoSQL solution.

Graph databases are captivating for their ability to quickly traverse lots of edges / relationships.
[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), [TigerGraph](https://www.tigergraph.com/), and [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/) are exciting options in this domain,
as well as [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) and [EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/).

For analytics, see [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/).

If you're building a payment rail, maybe you'd use [TigerBeetle](https://tigerbeetle.com/) and
its [Go SDK](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle-go) to go from [5,000 transactions per second](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-bitcoin-wont-displace-visa-or-mastercard-soon-2017-12-15) (TPS)
to 1 million TPS.

## Streaming

["Change Data Capture"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) (CDC) is a pattern for tracking and reacting
to changes in a database.

For small apps, you can reach for [supabase/realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime).

You can use [Materialize](https://materialize.com/) for OLTP
or [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/) for OLAP to power real-time materialized views,
Alternatively, [Debezium](https://debezium.io/) is often used to stream
events from a DB into [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

Want something [more performant](https://redpanda.com/platform) than Kafka
without having to mess with Zookeeper?
Check out [RedPanda](https://redpanda.com).

Also check out [Decodable](https://www.decodable.co/).

Sometimes a microservice just needs to be a SQL statement, as
argued by [Decodable](https://www.decodable.co/blog/microservice-should-have-been-sql-statement)
and [Materialize](https://materialize.com/docs/quickstarts/microservice/).
"If you are familiar with the SAGA pattern, you typically will develop a
set of microservices that work together as a transaction workflow. You could
potentially replace some of your microservices to be Decodable streaming pipelines."

## Orchestration

If you do write sagas and workflows that span across different microservices,
check out [Temporal](https://temporal.io/).

It's one of the only tools that lets you implement a distributed workflow
in [pure code](https://community.temporal.io/t/why-use-temporal-over-a-combination-of-aws-step-functions-and-aws-lambda/342),
easily contrasted with something like [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions).
With Temporal, you code workflows that are _actually_ complex, and
you get visibility into workflow status. Currently, you have to self-host
Temporal clusters, but a cloud offering is coming soon.

## API

The data from your backend has to get to your frontend, somehow.

### GraphQL

The dev experience working with GraphQL on the client-side has been pretty positive. [Auto-generating types](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/tooling/apollo-codegen/typescript-graphql-code-generator-generate-graphql-types/) helps massively.

For small projects that want a Dynamo-powered GraphQL API for free, go to [Grafbase](https://grafbase.com/).

[Hasura](https://hasura.io/) gives you a GraphQL API over your Postgres DB.

[GraphQL-Mesh](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh/docs) can give you a GraphQL API over a large number of [sources](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh/docs/handlers/handlers-introduction),
including gRPC APIs, SQL DBs, MongoDB, etc.

### gRPC

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is great for service-to-service communication.
The best part of this dev experience is using [protobufs](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers): they're performant, strongly-typed, and self-documenting.
The [Buf ecosystem](https://buf.build/) has made the experience of using protobufs orders of magnitude better,
thanks to their [tools](https://buf.build/product/cli/) around linting and breaking-change detection,
[remote library generation](https://buf.build/product/bsr/#remote-library-generation), and their [schema registry](https://buf.build/product/bsr/).
They even built a [better version of gRPC](https://connect.build/) itself, with a much [better replacement](https://buf.build/blog/connect-web-protobuf-grpc-in-the-browser) for grpc-web.

### tRPC

You may not need a traditional GraphQL layer.

With [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), clients can share the server's types and invoke RPC (queries and mutations).

There's no code generation either.

## Visuals

[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is my new favorite over [draw.io](https://draw.io).

For presenting, I'm intrigued by [SlideV](https://sli.dev/).
