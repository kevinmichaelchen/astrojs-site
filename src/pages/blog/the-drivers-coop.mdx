## A political journey

In 2021, my political intrigue starting moving leftward. I'd always labelled myself a left-liberal
or <Link external href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy">social democrat</Link> ("Europe has free healthcare and education, isn't that rad?").

After a year or two of reading Jacobin and finally reading
Lizzie O'Shea's <Link class="italic" external href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/3747-future-histories">Future Histories</Link>, I felt
like I saw the truest value of technology. It wasn't too enable billionaires to colonize Mars or aid in other fun frivolities.
It was to emancipate; to facilitate alternative ways of economic organization that prioritize peoples' needs over profit and unsustainable growth,
and prevent inequality, monopolization, and domination.

It's not that we need to dispense entirely with markets (although there's an
interesting <Link external href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2822-the-people-s-republic-of-walmart">case</Link> for
that as well); it's more that we could and should have saner defaults that remove the worst pathologies of our economic system.

Anyways, I was happy to discover that labor was and is organizing itself, under the name, The Drivers Cooperative.
Drivers in NYC were organizing and starting their own company to drive on their own terms
and escape the <Link external href="https://jacobin.com/2022/07/uber-files-leak-global-war-workers-lobbying">depredations</Link> of Uber, happening:

And in New York City.

In Fall 2021, I heard about the story
of <Link external href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/nyregion/nyc-taxi-suicides.html">Kenny Chow</Link> â€” a cab driver
who was drowning in $750,000 debt and eventually died by suicide â€” and the
ensuing <Link external href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqRHHUky0Lc">hunger strikes</Link>.

After listening to a <Link external href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/57UHLh0MiizZYdOTfaqNLn?si=80a1ab9369fa4d91">podcast</Link> featuring
the CTO of The Drivers Cooperative, I was hooked and knew
I wanted to support
the <Link external href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_cooperative">platform cooperative</Link> movement.

After volunteering for a few weeks, I knew I had to jump in full-time to
really accelerate my learning curve â€” (I had either never, or only marginally,
used <Link external href="https://hasura.io/">Hasura</Link>, Typescript, and <Link external href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql.html">Postgres functions</Link>).

I left my <Link external href="/blog/care-dot-com">role at Care.com</Link> and took a 50% pay cut to work as a contractor.

## Engineering

In the end, I made some cool contributions:

- a React-powered UI for dispatchers to manage their fleet, including a nifty Google Map which provided real-time trip locations and updates;
- a 15s -> 1s SQL query performance improvement using indexes, event sourcing, and denormalization (wider tables, fewer JOINS);
- an open-source, traffic-aware <Link external href="https://github.com/kevinmichaelchen/api-dispatch/">dispatch server</Link> written in Go and, ironically,
  powered by Uber's own geospatial indexing library, H3.

(Uber has made some insane contributions to the world of engineering, but that doesn't mean
their economic model shouldn't be revealed, scrutinized, condemned, and combatted. ðŸ˜Ž)

### Event sourcing

_Event sourcing_ was one of those patterns I had heard about for a long time but never actually used in production.

At TDC, it served us well both in terms of performance and in our ability to grok the actions taken by users.

For an explanation, imagine you have a job (trip) table. A job has an ID, a status (e.g., pending, in progress, complete), and an associated driver.

In the simplest CRUD applications, this _state table_ is all you'd have.
Mutations would happen directly to an entity, and there would be no trail of mutations occurred.

<div class="flex justify-center my-8 space-x-4">
  <Link href="/tdc/event-sourcing.png" external>
    <Image
      format="webp"
      width={420}
      aspectRatio="1716:1470"
      src="/tdc/event-sourcing.png"
      alt="Event sourcing description."
    />
  </Link>
</div>

Event sourcing provides that trail and lets you reconstruct _entity state_ based on a log of events (e.g., "job_log").
For simplicity, we decided log records could just have a jsonb payload. This kept the schema small and homogenous across
different types of tables (e.g., job_log, driver_log, vehicle_log â€” they all had that familiar jsonb column).

From the perspective of the UI client, instead of doing CRUD on the job table, they would shift to doing
change is you do inserts on the log table. The "event type" field is useful for distinguishing creations, updates,
and deletions. <Link external href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-trigger.html">Postgres triggers</Link> are
used to update the _state table_ (e.g., job) in tandem with the _log
table_ (e.g., job_log).
