# Personal Site

Scaffolded with [AstroJS](https://astro.build/) and their [blog starter kit](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog).

Built on [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Inspired by [@antfu](https://antfu.me/).

Still a WIP.

Features:

- ✅ Minimal styling (make it your own!)
- ✅ 100/100 Lighthouse performance
- ✅ SEO-friendly with canonical URLs and OpenGraph data
- ✅ Sitemap support
- ✅ RSS Feed support
- ✅ Markdown & MDX support

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                 | Action                                           |

| `pnpm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `pnpm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
